<h1>PATCHLIST EDITOR</h1>	

<p> > Allows selection of a MIDI-connected device's presets.</p>

<p>This is an implementation of what was once called a "MIDI librarian," which allows 
the presets of a MIDI-connected instrument or effects device to be browsed and selected
using the superior visual interface of a computer or mobile device. The librarian can 
eventually serve as the basis for a full-fledged visual patch editor.</p>

<p>MIDI librarians and editors were more common in the earlier days of MIDI. As of 2017, few
are available. More recent devices tend to have USB connections that allow them to be 
controlled from proprietary software. Older devices often have a minimal hardware 
interface and benefit greatly from the improved access to their features that a fully 
visual editor provides.</p>

<p>This was created from a combination of personal need and a desire for experience 
implementing data structures.</p>
